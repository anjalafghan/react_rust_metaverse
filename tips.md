Your directory structure is excellent—you're already thinking like a senior systems architect. Since you’re building a **Cargo workspace** with multiple crates (services and shared libs), the next step is to use Cargo effectively to build, test, and run your project.

## 🧰 Step-by-Step: Cargo Commands for Your Workspace

### ✅ 1. **Top-Level Workspace Setup**

In `backend/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "services/auth_service",
    "services/player_service",
    "services/world_service",
    "services/chat_service",
    "services/webrtc_signaling_service",
    "shared/proto_definitions",
    "shared/common_utils",
    "shared/db_access"
]
```

> This makes `backend/` a **Cargo workspace** that manages all crates.

---

## 🏗️ Common Cargo Commands (Run from `backend/` directory)

### 🔹 Build Everything

```bash
cargo build
```

### 🔹 Run a Specific Service

```bash
cargo run -p auth_service
```

> Use the crate name from `[package]` in `auth_service/Cargo.toml`

---

### 🔹 Add Dependency to a Service

```bash
cargo add tonic --package auth_service
```

---

### 🔹 Build Only a Shared Library

```bash
cargo build -p common_utils
```

---

### 🔹 Run Tests in One Crate

```bash
cargo test -p db_access
```

---

### 🔹 Check Everything

```bash
cargo check
```

---

### 🔹 Use `cargo doc` for All Crates

```bash
cargo doc --workspace --open
```

---

## 📦 Shared Crate Import Example

If `common_utils` defines a `log_error` function in `lib.rs`, use it like this in `auth_service`:

```rust
use common_utils::log_error;
```

Make sure your `auth_service/Cargo.toml` has:

```toml
[dependencies]
common_utils = { path = "../../shared/common_utils" }
```

---

## 🧪 Compiling Proto Buffers (Rust)

In `proto_definitions/build.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    tonic_build::compile_protos("proto/auth.proto").unwrap();
}
```

Run:

```bash
cargo build -p proto_definitions
```

This generates Rust code from `.proto` files into `OUT_DIR`.

---

## 🧰 Tooling Tips

* Use `cargo-watch` for hot-reload:

  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-watch
  cargo watch -x run -p world_service
  ```

* Use `just` for tasks (like Makefiles):
  `justfile` example:

  ```makefile
  dev-auth:
    cargo run -p auth_service

  test-db:
    cargo test -p db_access
  ```

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* **Keep `main.rs` small**: just start the server and pass config.
* **Shared logic goes in `lib.rs`** for every crate you want to reuse.
* **Use `mod` to split large modules**, especially in `world_service` and `webrtc_signaling_service`.

Would you like a working minimal scaffold with a dummy `auth_service`, `proto_definitions`, and `common_utils` just to get things running? I can generate that for you.
